 * gnutls_global_init_extra:

 * This function initializes the global state of gnutls-extra library

 *
 * Note that gnutls_global_init() has to be called before this
 * function.  If this function is not called then the gnutls-extra
 * library will not be usable.
 *
 * This function is not thread safe, see the discussion for
 * gnutls_global_init() on how to deal with that.
 *
 * Returns: On success, %GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (zero) is returned,
 *   otherwise an error code is returned.
