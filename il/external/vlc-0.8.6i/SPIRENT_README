# Steps to build (e.g. mips):

cd ../libdvbpsi5-0.1.6
p4 sync aclocal.m4@0
./bootstrap

cd ../vlc-0.8.6i
p4 sync aclocal.m4@0
./bootstrap

p4 edit mips-fp_be/...

./build-mips.sh

p4 edit mips-octeon/...

./build-mips.octeon.sh

p4 edit i386-pentium3/...

./build-pentium3.sh

p4 edit i386-pentium4/...

./build-pentium4.sh

# Other notes
# Spirent changes are marked SPIRENT_CHANGES
# As tools change it sometimes becomes necessary to disable new things in 
# the build-*.sh files (check configure).
#
# On capella4 --enable-libtool must be added because with it disabled
# libtool is still used to link and modern libtools don't work well with
# objects that are not also compiled though libtool. Also freetype, gnomevfs, 
# and libxml2 had to be disabled in the call to configure.
#
# On a build machine the build will attempt to write to the --includedir
# in configure, which is usually not writable. It seems safe to remove those
# lines (pkgincludedir and dist_pkginclude_HEADERS in src/Makefile.am)
#
# Finally, if bootstrap finds autopoint instead of gettext, you might
# have to open all the .po files in po/ for edit.
